<p>Statistics generated from administrative data that could be used to indicate performance of specific services, or the healthcare system as a whole. The performance of health services in a country has a significant impact on the welfare of citizens. Look for ongoing statistics generated from administrative data that could be used to indicate performance of specific services, or the healthcare system as a whole. Health performance data might include: Levels of vaccination; Levels of access to health care; Health care outcomes for particular groups; Patient satisfaction with health services.</p>

Where is a bill discussed next, so the public can participate in debates?</p>
